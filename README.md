# Sentiment analysis with PyTorch and BERT
A number of projects, the goals of which are to build a better understanding progressively in:
- Sentiment analysis with transformers and BERT
- Deep learning using PyTorch
- Tensorboard connected to PyTorch

As a final touch, using some of the trained deep learning models in an app to serve results (using FastAPI).
